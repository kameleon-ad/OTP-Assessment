    Assumptions:

- The email server used in this module is Office365 (I used Office365 for email server, because I don't have dso.org.sg email).
- The SMTP port used in this module is 587.
- The OTP code generated by this module is a 6-digit number.
- The OTP code is case-insensitive.
- The input stream provided to CheckOTP() method contains a single line of text with the OTP code.
- The input stream provided to CheckOTP() method is not closed by the method.
- The OTP code is considered invalid if it does not match the OTP code generated by the module.
- The OTP code is considered expired if the CheckOTP() method is called after the OTPExpiration time.
- The CheckOTP() method will wait for a maximum of nb_tries * expireMinutes * 60 seconds to receive the OTP code from the input stream. If the OTP code is not received within this time, the method will return a STATUS_OTP_TIMEOUT status. If the OTP code is received within this time, but is invalid, the method will continue waiting for nb_tries - 1 more times, or until the OTP code is valid, or until the OTP code is expired.

    Solution:

- The module provides an Email_OPT_Module class with the following public methods:
  * Email_OPT_Module(string emailAddr, string emailPswd): constructor that takes in the email address and password of the email account that will be used to send OTP codes.
  * void Start(): Initialize some private fields and create instances of SmtpClient and MailMessage.
  * void Close(): method that does nothing.
  * EmailStatus GenerateOPTEmail(string userEmail): method that takes in the email address of the user that will receive the OTP code, generates a 6-digit OTP code, sends an email containing the OTP code to the user's email address, and returns a status indicating whether the email was sent successfully, the email address is invalid, or an error occurred.
  * async Task<OTPStatus> CheckOTP(Stream input): method that takes in a stream containing the OTP code entered by the user, waits for the OTP code to be entered, and returns a status indicating whether the OTP code was entered correctly, incorrectly, or after the OTPExpiration time.
- The module assumes that the email server used is Office365, and the SMTP port used is 587.
- The module assumes that the OTP code generated is a 6-digit number, and is case-insensitive.
- The module assumes that the input stream provided to CheckOTP() method contains a single line of text with the OTP code, and is not closed by the method.
- The module assumes that the OTP code is considered invalid if it does not match the OTP code generated by the module.
- The module assumes that the OTP code is considered expired if the CheckOTP() method is called after the OTPExpiration time.
- The module assumes that the CheckOTP() method will wait for a maximum of nb_tries * expireMinutes * 60 seconds to receive the OTP code from the input stream. If the OTP code is not received within this time, the method will return a STATUS_OTP_TIMEOUT status. If the OTP code is received within this time, but is invalid, the method will continue waiting for nb_tries - 1 more times, or until the OTP code is valid, or until the OTP code is expired.
